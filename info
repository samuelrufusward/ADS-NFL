NFL info:

Snap: The snap is an important part of any football game, both tackle and flag, as it signifies the start of an offensive play.
The snap involves two players—the quarterback and the center.
When the teams are lined up and in formation for the beginning of a play, the quarterback calls “hike” to signal the start of the offensive play.
While there are many slight variations of a snap, the center ultimately then either hands or tosses the football between their legs to the
quarterback who is waiting to receive the football. This motion and exchange of the ball from center to quarterback marks the point when both
offensive and defensive players can start their respective routes and plays.

Operation time: Total operation time refers to the time it takes for the center to snap the ball, the holder to put it down and the kicker to
get the ball kicked. The total operation time from snap to kick should not exceed 1.3 seconds
